5 Acceptance criteria

1.Valid Input Handling: The application must accept valid numeric amounts and currency codes (e.g., "USD", "EUR") as input. If the input is invalid (e.g., non-numeric values or unsupported currency codes), the system should display an appropriate error message.

2.Exchange Rate Retrieval: The system must accurately retrieve the current exchange rate from a reliable source for the specified currency pair (e.g., USD to EUR). The exchange rate should be updated at least once every 24 hours to ensure accuracy.

3.Correct Conversion Calculation: The application must correctly calculate the converted amount based on the input amount and the retrieved exchange rate. The calculated result should be displayed with two decimal points of precision.

4.Usability: It should be easy to use, allowing users to quickly enter amounts and select currencies. Users should be able to perform a conversion.

5.Performance Requirements: The system should return the conversion result within 1 seconds of input submission. If there is a delay or failure in retrieving exchange rates, the system must display a clear error message to the user.
